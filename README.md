# PassLock
# Overview
This mobile application was created to save personal passwords on your phone. The application focuses on personal privacy since the passwords will not be saved onto
the cloud so you can feel secure.

# Web Pages
I have three pages in this application.
The first one will show you a logo that I created which will send you to the login page.
Second page will authenticate the user to enter the password page.
The third page will allow you to add your passwords to a txt file.

# Development Environment

The programs I used for this project was Android Studio.
The languages I used were java and the Android studio language.
